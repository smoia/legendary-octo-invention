niutils
=======

This is a quick collection of little (f)MRI utils functions collected together because I found myself using them quite often, packaged in pip to be easy to adopt.
I have no idea nor strict plan to where this project should/could/would go.
If you find yourself using this project (why?) let me know - so I can decide how to properly make it citable. 

**The project is currently (and in perpetuum) under development**.
Any suggestion/bug report is welcome! Feel free to open an issue.
